## About Me

I am a research engineer at the High-Performance Computing Center, Renmin University of China. I'm broadly interested in Machine Learning Systems, Data Science, and Data Management Systems.

I am also a technical writer. I have written articles and tutorials on various topics including distributed computing (e.g. [Flink](https://lulaoshi.info/flink/), [Distributed Python](https://godaai.github.io/distributed-python-en/)), and Deep Learning.

Previously, I was a big data engineer at [Xiaomi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaomi). I was a staff member of the recommendation system of the Xiaomi Browser. I also worked at [Zhipin](https://www.zhipin.com/), the largest online recruitment platform in China. 

I received my master's degree at Peking University and my bachelor's degree at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.
